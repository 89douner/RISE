* `notes.html` and `notes.js` here come, for now, from 3.8.0 as-is

* the two DIFF files show the patches that had been applied on the
  3.5.0 version

* for the record I have also decided to keep temporarily the 2 source
  files that came with 3.5.0

* all this ideally should be rewritten as a set of sed/patch rules for
  easier maintenance when revel.js upgrades

* finally, it is worth noting that with 3.8.0 Reveal offers
  keybindings as well; that is one of the differences in the js source
  code, so we can probably obtain the same result (changing the
  keystroke that triggers notes) without hacking the code; why is it
  again that we could'n't keep 'S' as the keystroke for notes ?
